üêç Snake AI - A* Pathfinding Algorithm
==========================================

A* (A-star) is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path 
between nodes using heuristics to guide the search.

Time Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
Space Complexity: O(b^d)

Key Components:
1. f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
   - g(n): actual cost from start to node n
   - h(n): heuristic estimate from node n to goal
2. Open set: nodes to be evaluated
3. Closed set: nodes already evaluated
